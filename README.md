# My Professional Portfolio

## Description

As a full-stack developer, I will need a professional portfolio to help land new jobs and display my projects to potential employers. With the skills developed in my bootcamp so far in CSS and HTML, I built this site to act as my first portfolio. It features a few of my initial projects and challenges from the bootcamp I am currently enrolled in and is both a test of my current skills as much as it is a place to gather my completed projects. It was also my first project in exploring media queries and responsive design.
